    "Welcome to part A of the Frequentist inference case study! The purpose of this case study is to help you apply the concepts associated with Frequentist inference in Python. Frequentist inference is the process of deriving conclusions about an underlying distribution via the observation of data. In particular, you'll practice writing Python code to apply the following statistical concepts: \n",
    "* the _z_-statistic\n",
    "* the _t_-statistic\n",
    "* the difference and relationship between the two\n",
    "* the Central Limit Theorem, including its assumptions and consequences\n",
    "* how to estimate the population mean and standard deviation from a sample\n",
    "* the concept of a sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean\n",
    "* how to combine these concepts to calculate a confidence interval"

      "    Different values of the argument `ddof` are useful in different\n",
      "    contexts. NumPy's default ``ddof=0`` corresponds with the expression:\n",
      "\n",
      "    .. math::\n",
      "\n",
      "        \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_i{|a_i - \\bar{a}|^2 }}{N}}\n",

      "    which is sometimes called the \"population standard deviation\" in the field\n",
      "    of statistics because it applies the definition of standard deviation to\n",
      "    `a` as if `a` were a complete population of possible observations.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Many other libraries define the standard deviation of an array\n",

      "    In statistics, the resulting quantity is sometimes called the \"sample\n",
      "    standard deviation\" because if `a` is a random sample from a larger\n",
      "    population, this calculation provides the square root of an unbiased\n",
      "    estimate of the variance of the population. The use of :math:`N-1` in the\n",

      "    Note that, for complex numbers, `std` takes the absolute\n",

As our samples will be expected to vary from one draw to another, so will our sample statistics. If we were to perform repeat draws of size $n$ and calculate the mean of each, we would expect to obtain a distribution of values. This is the sampling distribution of the mean. **The Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** tells us that such a distribution will approach a normal distribution as $n$ increases (the intuitions behind the CLT are covered in full on p. 236 of *AoS*).

In frequentist inference, we use the formulae above to deduce these population parameters.

This is the key driver for us 'requiring' a certain sample size, for example you may frequently see a minimum sample size of 30 stated in many places.
